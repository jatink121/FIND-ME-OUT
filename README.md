# FIND-ME-OUT, SOC
We began with getting familiar with basic concepts of python followed by numpy , pandas and matplotlib libraries.They are all extremely useful libraries and work best when one needs to analyse data. I faced difficulty understanding the concept of Q-Q plots and heat map .Although the tutorial was really thorough I couldnâ€™t seem to get the heat map.Then we moved to Linear and logistic regression . These are really important tools to analyze the data and make appropriate predictions based on the data.This was the first time i saw something like training a model, little did i know i would use it that much.Then finally we entres into the realm of image data analysis where i kearned that every image can be considered a set of numerical data and we performed K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering on data. I also highlighted particular clusters of image i was given as assignment called image segmentation which have a lot of practical uses.K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to divida given dataset into K distinct clusters. The algorithm aims to minimize thevariance within each cluster by iteratively assigning data points to the cluster withthe closest mean (centroid) and updating the centroid based on the newly assignedpoints.Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data pointsinto clusters based on their distances or similarities. It creates a hierarchicalstructure of clusters by successively merging or splitting clusters based on certaincriteria. The result is a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which illustratesthe relationships and similarities between data points.Neural Networks are a very powerful tool as you will see that most of what you have done so far in this project can be done easily using Neural Networks without much understanding of the data and much domain knowledge in that field.Now i will be dealing with tensorflow and completing the face recogition project.
